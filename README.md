**Developer Portfolio**
-------------
This is a re-make of my first portfolio website:
https://github.com/kirstenfrager/CFA-website-portfolio
After completing term 2 at CFA and looking back at my portfolio, I noticed a lot of code repetition, sloppy design and just too much going on in general.
The new version has a cleaner code, simpler design and is straight to the point.

### Design Changes

1. Fonts were changed to be more compatible on all browsers; previous portfolio wasn't rendering correct fonts for some users.
2. Video size rendered according to screen size
3. Projects and skills merged into one simple/clean page
4. Contact section has simple display of contact links only
5. About me page with write up and personal drone picture slider to show some personality

### Future Developments

>- Implement mailgun form (currently struggling to get mailgun to work once deployed to heroku)
>- A "click me" sort of sign to get users to press the bars for the navigation menu (am waiting to learn javascript for me to then implement this function)
>- Updates and more drone pictures for my carousel
